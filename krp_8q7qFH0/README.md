Teasers uses AI to auto-generate bite-sized topic content from your long-form YouTube video, without you having to create separate video clips for each topic.

If you were invited to talk at a conference, you can share each subtopic you talked about to Twitter, or link to them in your CV or personal website.

Teasers is free to use for those with a .edu affiliation.
